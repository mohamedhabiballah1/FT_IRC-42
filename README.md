# FT_IRC-42
Welcome to the IRC Server Implementation project! This repository contains the source code for a simple and customizable IRC server written in C++. IRC is a widely used protocol for real-time text communication on the Internet, and this project aims to provide a foundation for building your own IRC server or understanding the basics of IRC server development.

Key Features:

# Scalable and Extendable: Designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to add new features or customize existing ones.
# User Authentication: Supports basic user authentication to control access to the server.
# Multi-Channel Support: Users can join and participate in multiple channels simultaneously.
# Command Parsing: Implements essential IRC commands for communication and interaction.
# Non-blocking I/O: Utilizes non-blocking sockets for efficient handling of multiple client connections.
